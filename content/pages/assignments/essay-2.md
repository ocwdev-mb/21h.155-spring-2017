Essay 2: Visualizing Modernity
------------------------------

Choose 1 (one) image from the [MIT Visualizing Cultures](/ans7870/21f/21f.027/home/index.html) website and 1 (one) primary text that was assigned in class.

The image and text may represent complementary or contrasting perspectives. Make your case by citing specific examples from your selected sources.
