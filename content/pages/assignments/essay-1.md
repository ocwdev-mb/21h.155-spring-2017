Essay 1: Was late Tokugawa Japan actually in trouble? 
------------------------------------------------------

Given the discussions in Aizawa’s _New Thesis_ and Musui’s autobiography, is the story of Tokugawa Japan in the first half of the 19th century best understood as being primarily characterized by social, political, and economic decline?

Make your case by citing specific examples from the assigned texts. While you may cite secondary sources, the essay should mainly rely on the close reading of Aizawa and Musui’s writings to backup its arguments.
